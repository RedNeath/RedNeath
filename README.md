- 👋 Hi, I’m @RedNeath
- 👀 I’m interested in ...<br>
Music, programming, writing, drawing... Quite a lot of things actually<br>

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...<br>
I'm learning to draw and write properly, as I would like one day to publish a fantasy book.<br>

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...<br>
Not really anything so far... I still struggle trusting other's code a little. Feel free to ask some help from me though, I'd be happy to help on any open source project I like!<br>

- 📫 How to reach me ...<br>
<a href="https://discord.gg/g6XuGQTKZd">My discord server!</a> :D It's a server about the story I'm writing, so it won't be explicitly about programming, but I'm still open to talk
about anything on it. Don't hesitate to join it if you want to get in touch with me.
