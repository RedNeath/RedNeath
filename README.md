- 👋 Hi, I’m @RedNeath
- 👀 I’m interested in ...<br>
Music, programming, writing, drawing... Quite a lot of things actually<br>

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...<br>
IT as a student. I'm also learning to draw and write properly, as I would like one day to publish a fantasy book.<br>

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...<br>
Nothing so far... except maybe developing a linux compatible version of ModsStudio 2 (a program made to ease the creation of skins for ETS2)<br>

- 📫 How to reach me ...<br>
<a href="https://discord.gg/g6XuGQTKZd">My discord server!</a> :D It's a server about the story I'm writing, so it won't be explicitly about programming, but I'm still open to talk
about anything on it. Don't hesitate to join it if you want to get in touch with me.
